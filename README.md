## Bike Buyers Data Analysis in Power BI

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for analyzing the Bike Buyers data using Power BI. Follow these steps to load data, clean it, create visualizations, and build a comprehensive dashboard.

## 1. Load the Data
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click on `Home` -> `Get Data` -> `Excel` (or your data source type).
3. Select your file and load the data from the "Bike_Buyers" sheet.

## 2. Remove Duplicates
1. Go to `Home` -> `Transform Data` to open the Power Query Editor.
2. Select your table and choose the column(s) where you want to remove duplicates.
3. Click `Remove Rows` -> `Remove Duplicates`.

## 3. Find and Replace
1. In Power Query Editor, select the columns for "Marital Status" and "Gender."
2. Right-click on the column -> `Replace Values`.
   - For "Marital Status," replace `M` with `Married` and `S` with `Single`.
   - For "Gender," replace `F` with `Female` and `M` with `Male`.

## 4. Show Descriptive Statistics
1. In Power Query Editor, click `View` and tick `Column Profile` and `Column Distribution`.

## 5. Change Data Type
1. Still in Power Query Editor, select the "Income" column.
2. Change the data type to `Currency`.
3. Close and apply the changes.

## 6. Define New Variable (Age Bracket)
1. Go to `Modeling` -> `New Column`.
2. Enter the DAX formula:
    ```DAX
    Age Bracket = IF('Bike_Buyers'[Age] > 54, "Old", IF('Bike_Buyers'[Age] >= 31, "Middle Age", IF('Bike_Buyers'[Age] < 31, "Adolescent", "Invalid")))
    ```

## 7. Create a Matrix Visualization
In Power BI, creating a pivot table-like structure is done using the "Matrix" visualization. The Matrix visualization allows you to pivot your data across rows and columns, similar to a traditional pivot table.

1. Go to the `Report` view.
2. Click on the "Matrix" visual icon from the Visualizations pane.
3. Drag and drop the desired fields to Rows, Columns, and Values as needed.

## 8. Create Charts
For each chart:
1. Go to the `Report` view.
2. Select the desired chart type from the Visualizations pane.
3. Drag and drop fields into the Axis, Legend, and Values sections.
4. Format the chart as needed (titles, labels, colors).

## 9. Create Dashboard
1. Add a new page for your dashboard by clicking on the `+` icon at the bottom.
2. Copy and paste your charts onto this new page.
3. Arrange them as needed.
4. Go to `View` -> `Page Background` and adjust the grid lines if needed.
5. Add a title by inserting a `Text Box` from the `Insert` menu, and format it accordingly (font size, color, bold, etc.).

## 10. Add Slicer
1. Click on `Slicer` in the Visualizations pane.
2. Drag the desired field (e.g., "Marital Status") into the Field section of the slicer.
3. Click on the slicer, go to the `Format` pane, and configure as needed.
4. To sync the slicer across multiple visuals, go to the `View` tab and select `Sync slicers`.
5. Configure which visuals the slicer should affect.

## 11. Final Adjustments
1. Make any final adjustments to the layout and formatting to ensure the dashboard is clear and visually appealing.
2. Save your Power BI report.

Follow these steps to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for analyzing the Bike Buyers data in Power BI.
